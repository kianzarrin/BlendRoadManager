- slope: store the difference show the absolute. (done)
- cars on super elevated junctions tilt to the side while not moving. (fixed)

- test serialization.

- trains turn the wrong way on super elevated highways.


- test selecting nodes on top of another road (FRT + anarchy +  moveIT). (can't reproduce)
- when I select another segment end, values from the previously selected segment end are copied
  probabely because UI elements remember their old values. (can't reproduce)

- direction length field (influences and is influenced by values from the other dir fields).
- compelete hint box

- round values
- assert dx^2+dz^2 is 1 before slope calculations.. at the very list print warning.

- corner offset to increase chances of train track connection.
- fix the orientation of asym road
- support for asymetric textures
- lod support (not now)

- Toggle Crossing tool mod activatble from UUI.
